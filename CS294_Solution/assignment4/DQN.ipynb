    "In particular:\n",
    "* We use separate target and Q-functions estimators with periodic updates to the target estimator. \n",
    "* We use several concurrent \"threads\" rather than experience replay to generate less biased gradient updates. \n",
    "* Threads are actually synchronized so we start each one at a random number of moves.\n",

Note that environments that produce images will be much slower to train on than environments (like CartPole) which return an observation of the state of the system. But this model can still train on those image-based games - like Atari games. It will take hours-days however. It you try training on visual environments, we recommend you run the most expensive step - rmsprop - less often (e.g. every 10 iterations). This gives about a 3x speedup. "
